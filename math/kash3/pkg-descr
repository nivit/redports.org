KANT is a software package for mathematicians interested in algebraic number
theory. For those KANT is a tool for sophisticated computations in number
fields, in global function fields, and in local fields.

The main new features of KASH3 (the KAnt SHell) are

    * modular type system
    * integrated help system with inline help and a reference manual
      in html format
    * overloading of functions
    * local fields (unramified extensions, ramified extensions polynomial
      factorization)
    * access to the QaoS databases of numberfields and transitive groups
    * new generic function names
