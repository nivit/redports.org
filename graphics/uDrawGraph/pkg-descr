uDraw(Graph) creates your flow charts, diagrams, hierarchies or
structure visualizations using automatic layout - much faster
than with any standard drawing program.
With the API, uDraw(Graph) can even be embedded in your own programs
as a visualization component.

uDraw(Graph) was known as daVinci and daVinci Presenter (maintained
and supported by b-novative GmbH, Bremen) before.
